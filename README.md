My Arch setup notebook + dotfiles stash.

> [!NOTE]
> Under construction!

## Quick Stuff

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh dotfiles
./scripts/bootstrap.sh export
./scripts/bootstrap.sh packages
```

Docs site:

```bash
sudo pacman -S uv
./scripts/docs.sh sync
./scripts/docs.sh serve
```

Docs live in `docs/` and the MkDocs config is `mkdocs.yml`.
