My Arch setup notebook + dotfiles stash.

> [!NOTE]
> Under construction!

## Quick Stuff

```bash
make dotfiles-push
make export
make packages
```

Docs site:

```bash
sudo pacman -S uv
make docs-sync
make docs-serve

Docs live in `docs/` and the MkDocs config is `mkdocs.yml`.

Run `make help` for the full target list and common options.
