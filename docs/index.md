A browsable collection of important notes, useful tips & tricks plus common packages for daily Arch Linux use.

## Motivation

As a developer who cares deeply for privacy, open-source software & efficiency, it's safe to say I am not pleased with the slow and bloated state of Windows 11.

Considering Microsoft's decision to stop maintaining Windows 10, I decided it was the perfect time to make the switch Linux for the desktop - a facinating new landscape which has recently begun maturing rapidly.

Desktop Linux is not stable, nor mature, making expirimentation a requirement. Trying new things, finding new packages, building new programs, and so on, is important and this website exists to document that process.
