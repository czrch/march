## VSCodium

Free and open source VS Code without the Microsoft branding and telemetry.

**Installation:**

- **Binary (faster)**: `yay -S vscodium-bin`
- **From source**: `yay -S vscodium` (takes longer to build)

Pick the binary version unless you have a reason to build from source.

## Obsidian

Note-taking app that stores everything as plain Markdown files in a local folder. Great for a personal knowledge base.

**Installation:**

- **Binary (official)**: `yay -S obsidian-bin`

Pretty straightforward—just grab the binary from the AUR.

## MarkText

Simple and lightweight Markdown editor with a clean interface. Good for quick editing and distraction-free writing.

**Installation:**

- **From AUR**: `yay -S marktext`

Note: The build can be a bit slow and picky with dependencies. If it fails, you might want to use a clean chroot or check the AUR comments for workarounds.
