# 📚 Docs Index

Short entrypoint to all setup notes. Each doc should aim to answer:
**what it is**, **why you use it**, **packages**, **configs**, **steps**, **gotchas**.

## Topics

- `terminal/` — Zsh/Zinit setup, prompt, CLI tooling.
- `editors/` — Editor/IDE installs and extension lists.
- `tweaks/` — Small system tweaks and checklists (to add).
- `hardware/` — Machine‑specific notes (to add).

If you add a new area, list it here with a one‑liner.
